# FactIQ Data Tools

You are the analyst. FactIQ provides authenticated **MCP tools** for the whole
loop — discover the data (catalog, dataset/series search, read-only SQL, series
lookup, market data, earnings-transcript search), then publish the result (`share_chart`,
`share_report`). There is no server-side agent: you decompose the question, find
the data with the MCP tools, do the math with your own tokens, then either
answer directly in a sentence or author the output and publish it with a tool
call.

Five output modes:

- **Direct answer** — a plain-text sentence, no chart and no share link. Use
  when the question asks for a single current value or a simple scalar lookup
  where a chart would add nothing: "what's the US unemployment rate right now?",
  "latest CPI print", "Apple's trailing P/E". Still fetch the value with the MCP
  tools — only the *presentation* is a sentence. State the number with its
  period and source (e.g. "US unemployment was 4.1% in May 2026, per BLS.").
  The moment the question wants a trend, a history, a comparison across
  categories or entities, a breakdown, or explicitly asks for a chart or report,
  switch to one of the modes below.
- **Quick chart** (`share_chart` tool + `term_chart.py`) — one focused chart
  published to FactIQ as a share link, plus an inline terminal preview rendered
  from the same ChartSpec. Default for a single metric over time or a
  comparison across categories or entities. When geography is the finding this includes **maps**:
  choropleths by country or state/province and coordinate bubbles — see
  `references/output/chart-spec.md` (**Maps**) for the format and region-name rules
  (the terminal preview degrades to a ranked table).
- **Terminal chart** (`term_chart.py`) — an ANSI/ASCII preview without a share
  link. Use only when the user explicitly asks for terminal-only, ASCII-only, or
  local text output. See **Terminal charts** below.
- **Detailed report** (`share_report` tool) — summary + sections of narrative
  and charts + methodology, rendered on FactIQ's share-report page exactly like
  the in-house agent's reports, plus inline terminal previews of its charts. For
  broad or analytical questions. See **Detailed reports** below. Broad
  questions in a covered domain (bilateral trade, economic policy, monetary
  policy, fiscal revenue, business formation — see
  `references/report-patterns/README.md`) default here unless the user
  explicitly asks for only a quick chart. If the request is vague or
  comprehensive, run the explorer-agent interview in
  `references/report-patterns/interview-step.md` before data work; it clarifies
  scope without replacing the dialectical report method.
- **Bespoke local viz** (`build_viz.py`) — a self-contained HTML file you
  author freely and save locally, not published to FactIQ. Use when the answer
  needs something the ChartSpec can't express: a custom layout, a multi-panel
  dashboard, a force/flow/chord diagram, a novel encoding, or fine-grained
  visual control. See **Bespoke local visualizations** below.

**Data in, output out:**

- All discovery, fetching, **and publishing** go through the FactIQ **MCP
  tools** (`factiq MCP`). No codebase, database, or API key is
  needed — the coding agent calls them directly over one authenticated connection.
- The local scripts never touch the API:

  ```bash
  python3 scripts/term_chart.py render ... # terminal ChartSpec preview
  python3 scripts/build_viz.py  ...   # path relative to this skill dir
  ```

  Shell working directory resets between calls — resolve the script's absolute
  path once (from this skill's directory) and reuse it.

## Setup

One connection covers everything: the FactIQ **MCP server** bundled with this
plugin (`.mcp.json`), authorized over OAuth. On first use the coding agent runs
FactIQ's browser-based **Connect** flow. If the FactIQ tools are missing or
return an auth error, the connection isn't set up yet — tell the user to
authorize the MCP server:

- **Claude Code**: run **`/mcp`**, pick **factiq**, and complete the sign-in.
- **Codex**: run **`codex mcp login factiq`** and complete the sign-in.

The same FactIQ login works everywhere (email, Google, or passkey). Nothing to
copy or paste, and no separate key for publishing — the same connection
authorizes `share_chart` / `share_report`.

**Local development.** The bundled MCP URL is
`https://api.factiq.com/mcp`. For a local backend, edit `.mcp.json` in your
development checkout or configure a standalone `factiq` MCP server in Codex or
Claude Code that points at the local URL.

## Tools

All FactIQ tools are MCP tools provided by the `factiq` MCP server.

### Data

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `get_data_catalog` (`schemas?`, `full?`) | Per-schema index + the shared table DDL. **Call once per session before anything else.** `full=true` returns the heavy per-dataset dump (rarely needed — use `describe_dataset`). Schemas listed under `schemas_without_data` have no rows — skip them. |
| `search_datasets` (`query`, `schemas?`, `limit?`) | Keyword (not semantic) ranking of datasets across all schemas. **The first discovery step** — find the right `schema` + `dataset_code`. |
| `describe_dataset` (`schema`, `dataset_code`) | Full metadata for one dataset: topic, methodology, release dates, base-change notice, dimensions, example series. Call after `search_datasets`. |
| `search_series` (`schema`, `terms`, `limit?`, `include_compound?`) | Series-level title-substring search within one schema (`terms` is a list — prefer short stems). Includes `COMPOUND::` series. |
| `run_sql` (`schema`, `sql`, `question?`, `explore?`, `auto_retry?`) | Read-only SELECT against one schema. The power tool for joins, pivots, aggregation. |
| `get_series` (`schema`, `series_id`, `from_year?`, `to_year?`) | Fetch one series — timeseries, tabular, or `COMPOUND::` ids all work. |
| `get_market_data` (`function`, `symbol?`, `interval?`, `outputsize?`) | Quotes, daily/weekly/monthly series, fundamentals (OVERVIEW, INCOME_STATEMENT, EARNINGS), FX, commodities (WTI, BRENT, GOLD), SYMBOL_SEARCH. |
| `search_earnings_transcripts` (`query`, `search_target?`, `company_filter?`, `quarter_filter?`, `claim_family?`, `section?`, `detail?`, `limit?`) | Full-text (lexical, not semantic) search over earnings-call transcripts — atomic, quote-anchored rows decomposed from live calls, never a raw transcript dump. All query terms must match (websearch syntax; fuzzy fallback catches typos) — retry with the company's own vocabulary (`"capital expenditure"` vs `"capex"`) before concluding silence. An empty `query` browses the newest rows: with `company_filter` that reads one call's claim spine in spoken order. `search_target`: `"claims"` (default — management's guidance/comparisons/quantified statements, with `direction`/`value`/`unit` where checkable plus `assertion_status` — never present an `analyst_hypothesized` row as management's claim), `"pressure_points"` (what analysts pressed for in Q&A and whether management confirmed/declined/deflected, incl. the specific number refused), `"disclosure_profile"` (ticker-only lookup of what a company routinely discloses vs. withholds), or `"coverage"` (which tickers/quarters exist, with claim counts — call it first when unsure a company is covered). Narrow with `company_filter` (ticker or comma-separated `"MU,NVDA"`) / `quarter_filter` (e.g. `"FY2026Q3"`) / `claim_family` (18-code vocabulary — invalid values return the list) / `section` (`"prepared_remarks"` vs `"qa"`, claims only). `detail=true` adds `structured_fields` (the per-family quantified payload) and other normalized columns. `limit` is 1–50 (default 15). For filed XBRL financials use `run_sql` on the `sec` schema; for formally issued targets use `sec_guidance` — this tool covers what was said live. Full workflow: `references/report-patterns/earnings-intelligence.md`. |
| `get_style_guides` (`guides`) | FactIQ's house-style guides (`"chart"`, `"report"`, `"sql"`, `"earnings"`, or `"all"`). Optional; this skill's `references/` already cover the **publishing** JSON formats — use these guides for extra house-style detail. Fetch `"earnings"` before writing anything built from `search_earnings_transcripts` (quoting discipline, spoken-vs-filed sourcing). |

Every row-returning tool (`run_sql`, `get_series`, `search_earnings_transcripts`) returns **at most 50 rows**.
When a result comes back `"truncated": true` there is more data — your move is
to **aggregate or compute in SQL** (a `GROUP BY date_trunc(...)`, a
SUM/AVG/rank/ratio) and fetch that, or window a single series with
`from_year` / `to_year`. There is no "give me everything" option, by design —
see **Context budget** below.

### Publishing

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `share_chart` (`chart`, `question?`) | Publish a ChartSpec object (owned by your account, editable from the UI). Returns `{share_id, share_url}`. |
| `share_report` (`question`, `report`, `model?`) | Publish a multi-section report (`{summary, sections, …}`) as a public shared run. Returns the publish result incl. `share_url`. |

Pass the spec/report as the tool argument directly — build the object in your
context (or with the Write tool / local Python for large data arrays) and hand
it to the tool. A validation failure comes back as a tool error naming the bad
field; nothing is published until it validates.

### Terminal charts — `term_chart.py`

`term_chart.py` prints local ANSI/ASCII previews from normal FactIQ chart
objects. It never calls FactIQ. For `share_chart`, build the ChartSpec from data
you already fetched, save it to JSON, publish it, then render it:

```bash
python3 scripts/term_chart.py render --spec /tmp/factiq-chart.json --width 80 --charset ascii --color auto
```

For `share_report`, save the report object or the full `share_report` argument
object (`{"question": "...", "report": {...}}`) to JSON, publish it, then
render the report's charts:

```bash
python3 scripts/term_chart.py report --report /tmp/factiq-report.json --width 80 --charset ascii --color auto
```

Any time you create a shared chart or shared report, return both the share link
and the terminal preview. After `term_chart.py` renders, paste the preview
verbatim into your reply inside a triple-backtick code block; leaving it only in
the tool result hides it behind a collapsed block in Claude Code. Use
terminal-only output only when the user explicitly asks for no share link.

Supported terminal renderers:

| Renderer | Use when |
|---|---|
| `bar` | Categorical comparisons and short ranked lists |
| `line` | Time-series trends (one or more series) |
| `table` | Fallback for unsupported chart types or dense data |

Useful options:

| Option | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--type auto\|bar\|line\|table` | Pick the terminal renderer; `auto` maps from `ChartSpec.type` |
| `--width 80` / `--width auto` | Fixed width by default; `auto` reads the terminal size |
| `--height N` | Line-chart plot height |
| `--charset ascii\|unicode-block` | Strict ASCII or denser Unicode block glyphs |
| `--color auto\|always\|never` | ANSI color control; `auto` respects TTY, `NO_COLOR`, and `TERM=dumb` |
| `--max-charts N` | Report previews only: cap the number of rendered charts; `0` means all |
| `--out FILE` | Also save the rendered text |

Because agents often capture command output instead of streaming it directly to
the user's terminal, use `--charset ascii --color never` for previews you paste
into the final answer. Use ANSI color for real terminal stdout or saved `.ansi`
previews.

### Local viz — `build_viz.py`

`build_viz.py save … / assemble … / render …` saves raw tool results to disk
(no retyping), builds, and screenshots a bespoke local HTML viz (see **Bespoke
local visualizations**). Local-only; never calls the API.

## Orchestration workflow

0. **Interview before major forks.** If the request is broad, vague, or about
   to become a high-commitment workflow — especially a detailed report,
   multi-panel dashboard, bespoke visualization, or a report that could follow
   multiple scopes — use an explorer-agent interview before fetching data or
   spawning research subagents. Read
   `references/report-patterns/interview-step.md` and ask only the few choices
   that would materially change the work: detail level, audience, user context
   or hypothesis, priority lens, required/excluded entities, and time window.
   Pass the answers into all downstream research and assembler prompts as hard
   context. Skip the interview for direct answers, narrow quick charts, or when
   the user already gave clear scope, audience, and detail level. If the user
   does not answer, proceed with the defaults in the interview guide.
1. **Catalog first.** Call `get_data_catalog` once to get the compact
   per-schema index and the table DDL. It tells you what each schema covers,
   not every dataset. Skip schemas under `schemas_without_data`. (You rarely
   need `full=true`; use `describe_dataset` for detail on one dataset.)
2. **Find datasets, then drill in.** Call `search_datasets` to rank datasets
   across all schemas by keyword — the primary discovery step. Survey every
   schema that could be relevant before committing: for India check both
   `mospi` and `rbi`; for the US check `bls`, `bea`, `census`; energy means
   `eia`. Once a dataset looks right, `describe_dataset` for its dimensions and
   example series, then find the exact series with `search_series` (substring —
   prefer short stems like `rare`, not `rare earth`) or exploration SQL
   (`run_sql` with `explore=true`) on the `series` and `dimensions` tables.
   For multi-source stories, actually fetch data from 2+ schemas.

   Eurostat Comext is the exception: country schemas contain millions of
   series, so do not explore their `series` or `dimensions` tables by text or
   dimension value. Read the **Eurostat Comext country schemas** section in
   `references/data/sql-guide.md`; it uses the small product lookup table and
   exact indexed series IDs.

   **Domain report patterns.** If the question is broad and analytical —
   policy, trade, revenue, investment analysis, "what's driving X" — read
   `references/report-patterns/README.md` **before fetching**. It teaches the
   dialectical method every report follows (thesis: the headline reading;
   antithesis: the strongest contradiction, fetched, not footnoted;
   synthesis: one claim that explains both) and routes covered domains
   (bilateral trade, bilateral economic policy, monetary policy,
   fiscal-policy revenue, business formation) to a playbook of that domain's
   canonical antitheses with ready SQL. For domains without a playbook, apply
   the method directly. Either way it changes what you fetch, not just how
   you write it up. The interview step does not replace this method: it sets
   the user's preferred scope and audience first, then the report-pattern
   method determines the thesis, antithesis, synthesis, and data work inside
   that scope.

   For report-mode questions covering multiple topics, companies, or data
   sources, consider decomposing the research into parallel subagents — see
   **Subagent orchestration** below.

3. **Fetch in batches.** Once you know which series you need, issue the fetch
   calls together (multiple tool calls in one turn). Use `get_series` for 1–2
   known ids; `run_sql` with a CASE-WHEN pivot for 3+ series or joins. Keep
   results inside the 50-row cap — aggregate in SQL to the granularity a chart
   actually needs. For report tables, choose row granularity by context:
   monthly rows can work for shorter multi-year windows, roughly up to 3-5
   years, when timing, seasonality, or turning points matter; for longer
   windows, especially 5+ years, usually summarize with annual totals, YTD
   comparisons, latest/prior snapshots, or selected turning points. Do not
   default categorically to monthly or yearly rows.
4. **Compute yourself.** YoY growth, rebasing to an index, per-capita, ratios —
   write your own Python locally on the fetched values. There is no server-side
   code interpreter in this loop.
5. **Recent market data.** The DB lags for very recent market/price data — use
   `get_market_data` for current quotes, commodities, and FX.
6. **Answer, publish, render, or build.** Direct-answer mode: once you have the
   value, reply with a single sentence stating the number, its period, and the
   source — no ChartSpec, no `share_chart`, no terminal render. Quick-chart mode:
   build a ChartSpec object
   (see `references/output/chart-spec.md`) with wide-format data rows, save it to JSON,
   call `share_chart`, then run `term_chart.py render`; return the `share_url`
   and paste the terminal preview into your reply inside a triple-backtick code
   block. Terminal-chart-only mode: build the same ChartSpec, save it to JSON,
   run `term_chart.py render`, and paste the terminal output into your reply
   without publishing only if the user explicitly requested no share link.
   Report mode: build a report object (see
   `references/output/report-spec.md` and **Detailed reports** below), save it to JSON,
   call `share_report`, then run `term_chart.py report`; return the `share_url`
   and paste the terminal previews into your reply inside a triple-backtick code
   block. If a publish validation error occurs, fix and republish before
   rendering the final terminal preview from the corrected object.
   Bespoke-viz mode: save each fetched result to a JSON file with
   `build_viz.py save` (no retyping), author an HTML file,
   `build_viz.py assemble`, `build_viz.py render` to screenshot and iterate,
   then give the user the local file path (see **Bespoke local
   visualizations**).

## Subagent orchestration

For report-mode questions that span multiple distinct topics, companies, or data
sources, decompose the work into parallel subagents. This does two things:
each research thread gets a full, focused context instead of competing for
attention in one serial pass, and the report-assembly step gets the spec
loaded directly in its prompt so it never guesses at field names.

Before spawning subagents for a broad or underspecified request, run the
explorer-agent interview described in
`references/report-patterns/interview-step.md` unless the user already gave
clear scope, detail level, audience, and priority lens. Include the interview
answers in every research-agent prompt and in the report-assembler prompt so
the final artifact reflects the user's context instead of only the generic
version of the question.

### Explorer interview subagent

Use an explorer agent for the interview step, not a research subagent. Its job
is to clarify the decision, audience, scope, output shape, and success criteria
and return a compact brief. It should not fetch data, choose final chart
schemas, or publish anything. Research subagents run only after the brief and
the relevant report pattern are known.

**Do NOT use subagents** for quick-chart mode or single-topic questions — the
overhead is not worth it. The decision point is right after step 2 of the
orchestration workflow: once you have done the catalog lookup and initial
dataset discovery, you know whether the question decomposes into 2+ independent
research threads. If it does, fan out.

### Research subagents

Spawn one Agent call per research thread. Each agent inherits the skill's
FactIQ MCP tools, so it can discover, fetch, and compute on its own. Give each
agent a tightly scoped prompt and tell it to return structured findings — not
prose, not a published artifact.

Agent prompt template (adapt the specifics per thread):

```
You are a FactIQ research agent. Your job is to answer ONE sub-question and
return structured findings. Do NOT call share_chart or share_report — just
research and return data.

Sub-question: {sub_question}

Relevant schemas/datasets (from the parent's catalog step): {hints}

Steps:
1. search_datasets / describe_dataset / search_series to find the right series.
2. Fetch data with get_series or run_sql. Aggregate in SQL to stay under the
   50-row cap.
3. Save each fetched result to its own JSON file so a later charting step can
   load the exact numbers instead of re-querying FactIQ or retyping them.
   Right after each fetch, run (no retyping — it copies the payload from the
   transcript), giving each file a thread-unique name and a --match on a
   distinctive bit of your own SQL so a sibling agent's result can't be grabbed:
   `python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/build_viz.py save --tool run_sql --match "<distinctive SQL fragment>" --out /tmp/factiq-raw/{thread_label}-<name>.json`
4. Compute derived metrics (YoY, ratios, indices) yourself.
5. Return your findings as a structured block:

FINDINGS:
- sub_question: (echo it back)
- series_used: [{schema, series_id, title}, ...]
- sql_queries: [the exact SQL you ran, formatted multi-line]
- data: [{columns: [...], rows: [...]}, ...] — the actual fetched/computed values
- raw_data_files: [/tmp/factiq-raw/{thread_label}-*.json, ...] — the files you
  saved in step 3, so a downstream viz/report step loads exact data
- key_insights: [1-3 sentences stating what the data shows, with numbers]
- chart_suggestion: {chart_type, title, x_column, y_columns, units}
```

Launch the agents in parallel — multiple Agent tool calls in one turn:

```
Agent(prompt="<research prompt for thread 1>", label="research-supply-chain")
Agent(prompt="<research prompt for thread 2>", label="research-pricing")
Agent(prompt="<research prompt for thread 3>", label="research-demand")
```

Each agent runs independently and returns its findings block. Wait for all of
them before proceeding to assembly.

### Report assembler subagent

After all research is complete, spawn a single report-assembler agent. Its
prompt must contain two things: (1) the full content of `references/output/report-spec.md`
so the spec is in context, not behind a file read that might be skipped, and
(2) all the research findings from the previous step.

Before spawning the assembler, read `references/output/report-spec.md` yourself with
the Read tool. Then embed its entire content in the assembler's prompt.

Agent prompt template:

```
You are a FactIQ report assembler. Build a complete report object, publish it
with share_report, and render terminal previews for its charts. Do NOT do any
data discovery or fetching — all data is provided below.

USER QUESTION: {original_question}

=== REPORT SPEC (from references/output/report-spec.md) ===
{paste the full content of references/output/report-spec.md here}
=== END REPORT SPEC ===

=== RESEARCH FINDINGS ===
{paste all findings blocks from the research agents, labeled by thread}
=== END RESEARCH FINDINGS ===

Instructions:
1. Design 2-5 sections. Each section makes one claim its chart(s) prove.
2. Chart titles state the finding with numbers, not the topic.
3. Narratives are plain text — no markdown formatting.
4. Every chart must have columns, data (from the findings above), x_column,
   y_columns (for line/bar), sources, and lineage.
5. Lineage code must be formatted multi-line SQL/Python with real newlines.
   series_refs must list every series the step used.
6. Call share_report with question, report, and model. After it succeeds, save
   the full share_report argument object to JSON and run:
   `python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/term_chart.py report --report <json-file> --charset ascii --color never`
7. Return the share_url and paste the terminal previews into the reply inside a
   triple-backtick code block.
```

Launch the assembler:

```
Agent(prompt="<assembler prompt with spec + findings>", label="report-assembler")
```

The assembler has the full spec in context, so it builds the report object
correctly on the first attempt. It calls `share_report` itself and returns
the `share_url` plus terminal previews, which you relay to the user by pasting
the previews inside a triple-backtick code block.

### Example decomposition

Question: "How is the US EV market evolving — supply chain, pricing, and demand?"

After step 2 (catalog + discovery), you identify three independent threads:

| Thread | Sub-question | Schemas |
|---|---|---|
| Supply chain | What does US EV battery/component production look like? | `census`, `bea` |
| Pricing | How have EV prices and average selling prices changed? | `bls` (CPI), market data |
| Consumer demand | What are EV sales and registration trends? | `bts`, `bea`, market data |

Spawn three research agents in parallel. When all return, spawn one assembler
agent with the spec and all three findings blocks. The assembler builds a
3-section report (one per thread), calls `share_report`, renders terminal
previews, and returns both.

### When NOT to use subagents

- Quick-chart mode (single metric, single chart).
- Single-topic questions even in report mode ("How has US unemployment evolved
  since 2020?" — one thread, no decomposition needed).
- Bespoke local visualizations — the build_viz loop is inherently iterative and
  does not benefit from fan-out.

For these cases, do the research and publishing in the main context as usual.

## Detailed reports

A report is a public, fully rendered FactIQ research page: a bulleted summary
up top, then sections that pair narrative with charts, then methodology notes.
You author the whole thing — every chart's data rows, every narrative claim —
from data you actually fetched in this session. The JSON format, per-chart
fields, and a worked example live in `references/output/report-spec.md`. For reliable publishing, use a dedicated report-assembler subagent with the spec loaded in its prompt — see **Subagent orchestration**.

Ground rules:

- **2–5 sections, 1–2 charts each** is the sweet spot (server caps: 12
  sections, 16 charts). Each section should make one claim its charts prove.
- **Chart titles state the finding** ("Health care added 652k jobs in 2024 —
  triple tech's losses"), not the topic ("Jobs by sector").
- **Narratives are plain text** — markdown is not rendered on the report page,
  so `**bold**` shows up as literal asterisks.
- **Cite sources and lineage.** Every chart should carry `sources` (the
  datasets behind it) and `lineage` (the SQL/computation steps you actually
  ran). Charts without lineage get a generic "uploaded data" stub — fine, but
  real lineage makes the "How we built this" panel meaningful. Lineage `code`
  renders verbatim in a code block, so write it as formatted multi-line
  SQL/Python — never collapsed onto one line — and list **every** series the
  step touched in `series_refs`, not a single representative one.
- **Don't pad.** If the data only supports one chart, publish a quick chart
  instead of inflating a report.
- **Broad analytical questions get the dialectic.** Follow the
  thesis → antithesis → synthesis method in
  `references/report-patterns/README.md`: sections that only restate the
  headline reading are an unfinished report. Covered domains (bilateral
  trade, bilateral economic policy, monetary policy, fiscal-policy revenue,
  business formation) must additionally meet the required coverage in the
  playbook the README routes to — do not reduce them to the easiest single
  chart.

The `share_report` tool validates the report against FactIQ's real chart
schemas server-side, stores it as a completed public run, and returns the
`share_url`. After it succeeds, render the report object with
`term_chart.py report`, then paste the previews into your reply so the user gets
both the link and visible terminal previews.
The report appears in your FactIQ history and can be forked by anyone who opens
the share link.

## Bespoke local visualizations

When the answer wants something the published ChartSpec can't express — a
custom layout, a dashboard of several panels, a force/flow/chord diagram, an
annotated narrative, a novel encoding, or just fine visual control — build it
yourself as a self-contained local HTML file. There is no spec and no fixed
chart-type list: you author the HTML/JS (ECharts, D3, Canvas, SVG, WebGL),
inject the data you already fetched, then render and iterate. Read
`references/output/viz-guide.md` before starting — it covers technique selection, the
data contract, and the legibility checklist.

The tool is `scripts/build_viz.py` (local-only — it never calls the API):

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `save --out F.json [--tool run_sql] [--match STR] [--index N] [--list]` | Copy a tool result's **raw JSON from the harness transcript** to `F.json` — the shell copies the bytes, you never retype the data. Feeds `assemble --data`. Stdlib only. |

The loop that makes this work — **fetch → save → author → assemble → render →
look → fix**:

1. Fetch the data with the MCP tools, then **save each result to a JSON file
   with `build_viz.py save` — do not retype it via Write**. The MCP tools return
   their payload into your context, not to disk; `save` lifts that exact payload
   back out of the harness transcript so the shell copies the bytes (never
   re-emit a ~100-row result by hand — it double-pays the tokens and one
   mistyped digit ships a wrong chart with no error). Run one `save` per fetch,
   pinning the call with `--tool`/`--match`:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/build_viz.py save --match "korea_customs" --out /tmp/korea.json
   ```
   The file holds the tool's own `{columns, results, …}` payload — see
   `references/output/viz-guide.md` (**Saving data without retyping**) for `--list`,
   `--index`, and the fallback when a transcript can't be found. Because the MCP
   caps results at 50 rows, this is context-cheap; aggregate or window in SQL to
   get exactly the rows the viz needs.
2. Copy `assets/viz-shell.html`, add any CDN library you need, and author the
   viz. Keep the `__FACTIQ_DATA__` marker inside its
   `<script id="factiq-data" type="application/json">` tag — that exact element
   is where the data lands and how the page reads it back. After assembly the
   page exposes a `DATA` global; rows are at `DATA.<key>.results`.
3. `assemble` the self-contained file, then `render` it and **actually read the
   screenshot**. `render` exits **5** when the page logged a JS error or a
   failed request — that usually means a blank page; fix it before judging the
   visual. One render pass is never enough; budget two or three.
4. Hand the user the local file path; offer `--open` to open it in a browser.

If the viz will instead be published as a **claude.ai Artifact** that calls
FactIQ live from the page (`window.claude.mcp`), read
`references/output/viz-guide.md` (**Publishing as a claude.ai Artifact with
live data**) first. The critical rule: the artifact's capability manifest must
name the viewer's FactIQ connector **exactly as it appears in their claude.ai
Settings → Connectors** — that name is user-chosen and varies, so ask the user
for it; never put the plugin's local server name (`factiq` /
`plugin_factiq_factiq`) in the manifest, and have the page discover the
callable server at runtime with `listTools()` rather than hardcoding it.

## Context budget — the 50-row cap

Every row-returning MCP tool (`run_sql`, `get_series`) returns **at most 50
rows**, and there is no "give me everything" option — by design. The cap keeps
results context-sized, so you do **not** stage data to disk to protect your
context; you take the tool result directly.

When a result comes back `"truncated": true`, there is more data and your move
is to **aggregate or compute it in SQL**, not to try to fetch the raw rows:

- Roll a long daily/monthly series up with `GROUP BY date_trunc('month', time)`
  (or quarter/year) — a chart wants a few hundred points at most, and 50
  aggregated points usually says everything.
- Return a SUM / AVG / rank / ratio instead of the underlying rows.
- For one series, window it with `get_series(..., from_year=, to_year=)`, or
  make a few windowed calls and stitch them.

Whatever you chart or report has to be the aggregated result you bring back —
which is also all it needs. For `build_viz`, persist that (already small) result
to a JSON file with `build_viz.py save` before assembling — it copies the
payload from the transcript so you never retype the rows.

## Errors and limits

- **MCP tool unavailable / auth error** — the FactIQ MCP isn't connected. Tell
  the user to authorize it (Claude Code: `/mcp` → factiq; Codex:
  `codex mcp login factiq`). The same connection authorizes both the data tools
  and `share_chart` / `share_report`, so this fixes publishing failures too.
- **429** — either the 1 request/second rate limit or the monthly tool-call
  quota (the error says when it resets). Note that publishing counts against the
  same monthly tool quota as the data tools. Don't burn calls re-fetching data
  you already have.
- **403** — that schema is admin-restricted for this account; drop it.
- **SQL errors** come back in the tool result as an `error` (syntax errors,
  timeouts, bad column names). Revise the query and rerun.
- **Zero rows** — your filter was too narrow. Broaden it yourself (see
  `references/data/sql-guide.md`). `auto_retry=true` opts into a server-side LLM
  reviser, but you can usually revise better and cheaper yourself.
- **SQL timeout** — statements are capped at 30s. Filter on indexed columns
  (`series_id`, `dataset_code`) instead of scanning titles, and never
  pattern-match `series_id` on `data_points` — resolve ids from `series` first
  (see the pitfall in `references/data/sql-guide.md`). For `eu_comext_*`, do
  not retry a dimension scan; use `eu_comext_lookup.product_codes` and exact
  IDs as described in the Comext section of that guide.
- **Publishing validation error** — `share_chart` / `share_report` validate the
  payload against FactIQ's real chart schemas and return a tool error naming the
  failing field paths (e.g. `sections[1].charts[0].x_column`). Fix the named
  fields and call the tool again; nothing is published until it validates.

## References

**`references/data/`** — the data layer:

- `schemas.md` — what lives in each schema. The `get_data_catalog` tool is the
  live, authoritative version; `search_datasets` / `describe_dataset` drill
  into individual datasets on demand.
- `sql-guide.md` — table structure, query idioms, pitfalls (frequency
  literals, national vs sub-national, pivots, tabular data).

**`references/output/`** — the publishing formats:

- `chart-spec.md` — ChartSpec format, chart-type selection, a worked
  `share_chart` example.
- `report-spec.md` — report JSON format for `share_report`: sections,
  per-chart fields, sources/lineage authoring, limits, a worked example.
- `viz-guide.md` — bespoke local HTML visualizations with `build_viz.py`: the
  assemble/render loop, the `DATA` contract, technique selection
  (ECharts/D3/Canvas/WebGL), a legibility checklist, starter recipes.

**`references/report-patterns/`** — how to think about broad analytical
questions. Start at `report-patterns/interview-step.md` when the request is
vague or high-commitment; it defines the explorer-agent interview that
clarifies scope and audience before data work. Then read
`report-patterns/README.md`: it teaches the dialectical method (thesis →
antithesis → synthesis) that every report follows and routes covered domains
(bilateral trade, bilateral economic policy, monetary policy, fiscal-policy
revenue, business formation, and any added later) to a playbook of that
domain's canonical antitheses with ready SQL. For uncovered domains —
investment analysis, general macro — the README shows how to apply the method
directly.
