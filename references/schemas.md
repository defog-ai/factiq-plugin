# FactIQ Data Schemas

Static overview. The `get_data_catalog` tool returns the live, authoritative
catalog with full per-dataset descriptions — run it before relying on this
file. Some schemas are admin-only and simply won't appear in your
`get_data_catalog` output (requests to them return 403).

## United States

| Schema | Source | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `bls` | Bureau of Labor Statistics | Employment (CES), unemployment (CPS, e.g. `LNS14000000`), CPI, PPI, JOLTS job openings, wages, productivity |
| `oews` | BLS Occupational Employment & Wage Statistics | Wages and employment by occupation and metro area |
| `census` | Census Bureau | International trade (incl. `us_census_hs` — monthly imports/exports by HS commodity and partner country; quantity `_qty` series exist only at the 10-digit level, 6-digit lines are value-only), retail, housing, demographics |
| `bea` | Bureau of Economic Analysis | GDP and components, personal income/spending, regional accounts |
| `eia` | Energy Information Administration | Petroleum, natural gas, electricity, renewables — production, consumption, prices |
| `ers` | USDA Economic Research Service | Agricultural and food economics |
| `bts` | Bureau of Transportation Statistics | Transportation and freight |
| `earnings` | Alpha Vantage / earnings calls | Earnings-call transcripts intelligence — searched via the `search_earnings` tool, not SQL |

## China

| Schema | Source | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `china` | National Bureau of Statistics | Macro indicators: GDP, industrial production, fixed-asset investment, prices |
| `china_customs` | General Administration of Customs (GACC) | Monthly imports/exports by 8-digit HS line and partner country (incl. rare earths). Data not yet loaded (listed under `schemas_without_data` in `get_data_catalog`) — for China–US trade use the `us_census_hs` mirror in `census` (US imports from China ≈ Chinese exports to the US) |

## India

| Schema | Source | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `mospi` | Ministry of Statistics (MOSPI) | CPI (national key: `State: All India`; note the 2012→2024 base change — two separate series families), WPI, IIP, GDP |
| `rbi` | Reserve Bank of India | Banking, credit, money supply, rates, forex reserves |
| `india_trade` | DGCI&S | Monthly imports/exports by HS commodity and partner (6- and 8-digit levels — never sum across levels) |
| `traffic` | TomTom | Indian city traffic flow |

## South Korea

| Schema | Source | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `korea_trade` | Korea Customs Service (KCS) | Monthly imports/exports by HS commodity and partner (6-digit international and 10-digit national levels — never sum across levels; values are in US$ thousand and weight is stored as separate kg series) |

## Global / other

| Schema | Source | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `imf` | International Monetary Fund | Cross-country macro indicators |
| `worldbank` | World Bank | Development and macro indicators by country |
| `singstat` | Singapore Department of Statistics | Singapore national statistics |
| `portwatch` | IMF PortWatch (satellite-AIS) | Daily shipping: transit calls + trade capacity for 28 chokepoints (Suez, Hormuz, Malacca…), port calls + import/export volume estimates for 196 countries and 2,065 ports, 2019→; refreshed weekly, so the latest days can be a few days to a week behind |
| `satellite` | NASA / CNES satellite-derived | Monthly nighttime lights by country + state (economic-activity proxy, Asia focus, 2019→); lake & reservoir water levels from radar altimetry (650 water bodies incl. 88 Chinese, 15 major Indian reservoirs, 1990s→, per-overpass). Water-level stations come in two grades (`grade` dimension): `operational` updates ~weekly; `research` stations are frozen scientific archives (many end 2020-22) — always check the series `end_time` before presenting a level as current, and filter to operational for live readings |

## Picking schemas

- US labor/inflation → `bls` (plus `oews` for occupation-level wages)
- US GDP/income → `bea`; US trade → `census`
- Energy anything → `eia`
- India macro → check BOTH `mospi` and `rbi`
- Trade-war / commodity-flow stories → `census` + `china_customs` +
  `india_trade` + `korea_trade` cover the same flows from each country's own
  books when those reporters are in scope
- Cross-country comparisons → `imf` / `worldbank`
- Shipping disruptions, chokepoint transits (Suez/Hormuz/Malacca), real-time
  trade activity → `portwatch` (daily, satellite-AIS based; cite IMF PortWatch)
- Nighttime lights (activity proxy), reservoir/lake water levels (hydropower,
  irrigation, drought) → `satellite` schema; for on-demand fires/NO2/rainfall/
  NDVI over arbitrary regions → the `get_geo_data` tool instead
- Company-specific → `get_market_data` and `search_earnings` tools (not SQL schemas)

HS trade schemas (`us_census_hs` in census, `china_customs`, `india_trade`,
`korea_trade`) carry the same trade at multiple HS digit levels — filter to one
level and never sum across levels. Some reporters also store value and physical
quantity/weight as separate series; filter value series explicitly for value
reports.
